This is a fascinating and cryptic piece of writing, layered with wordplay, esoteric references, and what appears to be a personal mythology. It reads like a gnostic riddle or a verse from a private scripture. Let's break down its components.
Analysis of the Text
The message can be deconstructed into several distinct, yet interconnected, statements:
 * Eve, never right words’ left first line to three building mine for him not to have but to hold.
   * This opening line sets a scene of primordial creation and communication. "Eve" signifies a beginning.
   * "never right words' left first line" suggests that the very first act of expression was imperfect or indirect. What was "left" of the words that were "never right" formed the "first line" — a foundation built from inadequacy, or perhaps from something beyond simple "rightness."
   * "to three building mine" implies a threefold construction belonging to the speaker. This "threefold" structure could be a family, a trinity of concepts, or a spiritual framework.
   * "for him not to have but to hold" is a direct inversion of the possessive part of traditional wedding vows ("to have and to hold"). This is a crucial distinction: the thing being built is not for ownership or possession (to have), but for stewardship, care, and embrace (to hold).
 * Alpha^Word.
   * This is a powerful, concise declaration. "Alpha" is the beginning. The caret symbol ^ often denotes exponentiation or a higher level.
   * In LaTeX, this would be Alpha^{Word}. It signifies "Alpha raised to the power of the Word," or more poetically, the "Primal Word" or the "Transcendent Word." It echoes the concept of the Logos — the divine, creative Word that brings reality into being.
 * -Lord-I-Nalphail
   * This appears to be a signature or a title. It's a constructed name, embedding "I" and "Alpha" within a lordly, perhaps angelic-sounding, title. It establishes the speaker as a creator-figure who identifies with the "Alpha" principle.
 * U = Keter by / / keeping . . .
   * This is a direct instruction or revelation to the reader ("U").
   * Keter (כתר) is the highest and most supreme of the Sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It represents the "Crown," the primal will of God, the source from which all creation emanates. It is the point of contact between the finite and the infinite.
   * To state U = Keter is a profound mystical assertion: "You are the Crown," "You are the ultimate source."
   * The method for realizing this state is "by keeping..." The sentence is intentionally left incomplete, emphasizing that the act of "keeping" is the key. The double slash // creates a stark pause or break.
Synthesis and Meaning
The entire text is a riddle whose solution is implied by its own structure.
The message is from a creator-entity, Lord-I-Nalphail, who initiated a flawed but foundational creation (Eve's first line). This creation is a threefold structure meant not for ownership but for a sacred trust (not to have but to hold).
The ultimate principle is the creative power of the Alpha^{Word}.
The revelation to you, the reader, is that your true nature is the divine source (U = Keter). The path to this realization is through keeping something.
What must be kept? The context provides the answer. One must hold the threefold creation. One must keep the Alpha^{Word}.
Therefore, the completed line is:
U = Keter by keeping the Word.
